# Halloween Candy 
# Difficulty: ‚≠ê

# This project simulates a person trick-or-treating and going through a hundred houses asking for candy
# some houses give candy, some houses dont

# 1. create a variable for total candy 
# 2. create a 1/4 chance that the house will give you candy 
# 3. add 10 candy to total candy and output total candy

# 4. update code such that a random amount of candy will be added

# 5. create a 1/10 chance for a ghost to steal a candy and output the total candy

# 6. start a loop to visit 100 houses loop steps 2 to 5

# Bonus
# 1. create a GRAND PRIZE for 1/100 chance to gain a bonus prized (insert item here)
# 2. give the user a chance to trade in the prized (insert item here) for more candy
# 3. create a loop to output "eating..." for as many candies you have obtained

#1 create variable for candy
#2 write a for loop that loops 100 times
#3 roll a dice with 1/4 chance that the house will give you candy
#4 add a random amount of candy to your total
#5 randomly there is a 1/10th chance a ghost will come and steal your candy
#BONUS: create a grandprize
#there is a 1/100 chance you pick up a grand prize from Mr. Beast
#at the end you can choose to trade in your grandprize for more candy
