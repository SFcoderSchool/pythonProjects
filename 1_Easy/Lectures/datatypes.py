#1 numbers strings vs integers. looks exactly the same in console.
print("9")
print(9)


#2 how do they differ
#strings are characters with no value (display only)
#integers are numberically valued (math)
#question: when are numbers strings not integers? jersey numbers, phone numbers, your number in line
print("9"+"9") #combines two characters
print(9+9) #generates math


#3 words
print("hello")
print(hello) #why did this break? Is this a integer?


#4 variables hold data that can be retrieve, used, and changed. can hold strings, integers, or variables
name = "jeff"
print("hello", name)


#5 what happens if you try to use a string with an integer? There are cases where some combos work and others don't.
print("9"+9) #breaks
print("9"*9) #works
print("9" == 9) #works but False
