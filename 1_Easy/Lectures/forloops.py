# Use a for loop when you know the number of times you want to repeat
# example: eat 10 hotdogs

# Structure: 
# for [some variable typically i] in range(start, stop, step):
#   do stuff
#   the indentation is important


# 1 for loop as repeat count
for i in range(0,10,1):
  print("hello")


# 2 check variable in for loop-variable can be any name
for i in range(0,10,1):
  print(i)


# 3 parameters or range (start, stop, change) 
# NOTE: stop parameter is always short one
for i in range(0,10,1):
  print(i)


# 4 adjust parameters
for i in range(1,11,1):
  print(i)



#exercises:
#print numbers 1 through 100 inclusive
#print numbers 100 through 1 inclusive
