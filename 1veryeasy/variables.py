#Start by asking what the student thinks a variable is.
#Afterwards give them examples.
money = 100
age = 12
name = "Jason"
#take this oppurtunity to expalin data types and the difference between an Integer/Number and a String/Text
#Also try to explain why we need quotations for Text/Strings and not for variables
#print those variables out to show them on screen
print(money)
print(age)
print(name)
#Now ask the student to build variables of their own.
#1) make a variable called grade, set it equal to your grade.

#2) make a variable called vacation, set it equal to where you want to go on vacation.

#3) make a variabled called favorite_game, set it qual to your favorite game.

#4) print out the three variables


# Next lets explain variable math
# simply start by showing whats intuitive but wrong

money + 100
print(money)

# in this case the money variable remained unchanged
# explain how the computer calculates an answer but doesnt rememeber it
# next explain the importance of the = symbol and how it is necessary to save the result of the math equation to a variable
money = money + 100
print(money)
