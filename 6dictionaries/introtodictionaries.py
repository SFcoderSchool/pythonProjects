#a dictionary is like a list of variables and their values
menu = {
    "chicken": 6,
    "bread": 4,
    "apple": 2
}
#in this example "chicken" is holding the value of 6
#"bread" has the value of 4
#"apple" has the value of 2
#we refer to this as the key and their value
#next we will program how to look up a value in the dictionary
print(menu["chicken"])
#the syntax is simlar to accessing data in a list 
#except we don't use index # but rather we look up what "chicken" is equal to in the dictionary
#Exercise:
#1) print out the value of bread in the dictionary
#2) print out the value of apple in the dictionary
#3) create a dictionary of technology and their costs


#Some useful tools/techniques to remember:
#all the keys in the dictionary listed out for you
allKeys = list(menu.keys())
print(allKeys)
#iterate through all keys in the list with a for loop
for i in range(len(allkeys)):
    print(allKeys[i])
#print all VALUES in the list by iterating through all keys in the list with a for loop
for i in range(len(allKeys)):
    eachKey = allKeys[i]
    print(menu[eachKey])
