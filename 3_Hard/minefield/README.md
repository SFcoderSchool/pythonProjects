# Minefield <br> ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

## Background

Traverse through the field, advance every round by either going left, right, or straight

## Steps

1. generate the 10x5 grid filled with bombs

```python
minegrid = []

for i in range(10):
  row = []
  for j in range(5):
      row.append("üí£")
  minegrid.append(row)
```

2. print out the grid of bombs neatly
3. NOTE: will most likely use this set of instructions later on, turn into function

```python
def printGrid():
  for i in range(len(minegrid)):
    print(" ".join(minegrid[i]))

printGrid()
```

4. starting at the last list, in the middle, clear a path to the first list for the user
5. NOTE: don't go out of bounds

```python
import random

...

column = 2
for i in range(10):
  minegrid[9-i][column] = "‚¨ú"
  column += random.randint(-1,1)
  if column < 0:
    column = 0
  if column > 4:
    column = 4
```

6. create a separate grid filled with covers
7. print out the grid of covers to cover the bombs with dirt
8. NOTE: instructions will look the same as printing out the bombs, update function to accept a parameter

```python
dirtgrid = []

for i in range(10):
  row = []
  for j in range(5):
      row.append("üü®")
  dirtgrid.append(row)

def printGrid(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    print(" ".join(grid[i]))

printGrid(dirtgrid)
```

9. make the player emoji
10. keep track of the position fo the player

```python
player = "üßç"
col = 2
row = 9

dirtgrid[row][col] = player
printGrid(dirtgrid)
```

11. use readchar to accept key inputs a, w, d
12. advance the player depending on the input
13. replace the current spot back to blank
14. put the new player into the new spot it advanced into

```python
import readchar

...

k = readchar.readkey()
  if k == "a":
    dirtgrid[row][col] = "‚¨ú"
    col -= 1
    row -= 1
    dirtgrid[row][col] = player
  if k == "d":
    dirtgrid[row][col] = "‚¨ú"
    col += 1
    row -= 1
    dirtgrid[row][col] = player
  if k == "w":
    dirtgrid[row][col] = "‚¨ú"
    row -= 1
    dirtgrid[row][col] = player
```

15. check to see if player ran into a bomb, if they did reset the player

```python
if minegrid[row][col] == "üí£":
  dirtgrid[row][col] = "üí£"
  col=2
  row=9
  dirtgrid[row][col] = player

printGrid(dirtGrid)
```

16. add a while True loop to repeat the game
17. stop the game when user reaches the end

```python
import os

...

while True:

  ...

  os.system("clear")
  printGrid(dirtgrid)
  if row == 0:
    print("YOU WIN!")
    break
```
