# Battleship
# Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
# single player game inspired by the board game battleship

# Steps:
# 1. create the 10 by 10 grid of water
# 2. output the grid neatly
# 3. NOTE: will most likely use this code more later, convert to function

# 4. set the size of a ship to 3
# 5. generate the row and col locations of a ship
# 6. randomly flip a coin to see which direction to ship will grow
# 7. from the original point, travel in the direction chosen for the size of the ship
# 8. NOTE: either travel down or right to avoid index out of bound
# 9. save these locations into a list
# 10. convert this to function when working

# 12. run this function 4 times to generate 4 ships
# 13. save all the coordinated into a list
# 14. print out the list
# 15. NOTE: there will be duplicate coordinates
# 16. update function to run again if there was a duplicate coordinate

# 17. create a list to remember all the coordinates of the ships 
# 18. ask the user for a row
# 19. ask the user for a column
# 20. check to see if the guess was a hit or a miss
# 21. add a while True to repeat
# 22. stop when there are no more ships
