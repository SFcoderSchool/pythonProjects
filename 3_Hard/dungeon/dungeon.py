# Dungeon
# Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
# Enter a dungeon as the player and retrieve the goal while avoiding the enemies

# Steps:

# Generate board
# 1. create an empty board list
# 2. add 10 rows list into the board
# 3. add 10 "_" into each row

# 4. print out the each row in the board
# 5. NOTE: convert this process into a function 

# 6. create a variable for the player and save an emoji in it
# 7. randomly pick a random row for the player
# 8. randomly pick a random col for the player
# 9. place the player into its randomly chosen place and printBoard to test

# 10. repeat for the goal

# 11. create a count for the amount of enemies to spawn
# 12. create an empty list for enemies rows
# 13. create an empty list for enemies columns
# 14. add random numbers into the list for however many enemies there are
# 15. for all enemies put them onto the board

# Player movement
# 16. use readchar.readkey() and check the user input
# 17. depending on their input, move the piece accordingly

# 18. NOTE: piece may go out of bounds
# 19. add checks to make sure piece does not go out of bounds

# Enemy movement
# 20. for all enemies
# 21. generate a random number from 1 to 4
# 22. depending on the number, reset the current position back to blank, move the piece accordingly

# 23. NOTE: piece may go out of bounds
# 24. add checks to make sure piece does not go out of bounds

# Check for game over states 
# 25. check to see if the player coordinates are on the goal coordinates
# 26. check to see if the player coordinates are on any of the enemy coordinates

# Simplify
# 27. NOTE: adding a while True: to the game would be very long and confusing; should make functions
# 28. convert the generate game board / pieces into a function
# 29. convert the player movement into a function
# 30. convert the enemy movement into a function
# 31. convert the update characters into a function
# 32. convert the logic for loss into a function
# 33. convert the logic for win into a function

# Final Game Logic
# 34. start a while True and repeat the steps for the game
# 35. playermovement, enemymovement, drawcharacters
# 36. if win then generate a new board with new positions
# 37. if loss then break the loop and say you lose
# 38. clear and print wherever needed

# Bonus
# 1. update code where a new enemy spawns after each level
# 2. update code to allow use to enter how big they would like the board
