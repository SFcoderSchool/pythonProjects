#1 define bomb, safe, blank space. Use emoji or text is ok.
#2 create empty board list to store 10 blank characters.
#3 create variable and store random index to represent bomb's location
#4 display empty board for player to see
#5 let user pick a location
#6 if the input matches the bombs location flip into bomb. If not, flip into safe.
#7 allow player two to have a turn
#8 loop game until someone triggers the bomb
#9 announce winnet and loser

#bonus: try switching inputs fro 0-9 to 1-10
#bonus: try switching turn picking into a function (only if you have covered functions)
#bonus: try using a while loop instead of for loop

### WHILE LOOP METHOD ###
