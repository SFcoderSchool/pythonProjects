  Notes:
    - Organize other websites into folders with its matching files
    - NOTE: paths might be different, so make sure there is a direct path to the html files or folders
    - Add the other pages to this website
    - Given the way replit is limiting the projects, this project technically might be done if the projects are organized in folders already. Just add the navigation bar to each page and make sure they're standardized. 
    - Styling in this project is similar across the pages, but if each project has a style.css already, it can just use that style.
